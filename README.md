The repo contains all the NLP projects done in my CSE undergrad at IIT-KGP.

One can directly run these programs using Google Colab or Jupyter.

Python files can also be generated Google Colab or Jupyter.

Brief discription about each of the projects:

1. Project-1: Using Language models to predict next words of a document and finally testing each of the language models used.

2. Project-2: Naive Bayes classifier (from scratch) and LSTM based classifier for sentiment analysis. The models by accuracy on IMDB dataset. This dataset consists of 50k movie reviews (25k positive, 25k negative).

3. Project-3: The central idea is to experiment Name Entity Recogniztion using pretrained language model BERT. The NER data is spit into train and validation, and evaluation of the model is done on the validation.
